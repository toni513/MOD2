Very popular with Tacos al Pastór or Tacos de Canasta, it is a creamy, green sauce. It has avacado, but it by no means a guacamole. Usually available with other taco cart staples such as: sliced radishes, spicy salsa roja, fresh cilantro, and fresh limes.\n\n* 1/2 Kilo of Green Tomatillos (~1lb.)\n* 2 green Serrano peppers (optional for heat)\n* 1 avocado\n* 2 limes\n* 1/2 cup crema (Mexican sour cream, thinner and sweeter than standard sour cream)\n\nCook the tomatillos and peppers in a pot with water until soft. Drain the water out and let cool.\n\nPut tomatillos, peppers, salt, lime-juice, crema, and avacado (shelled and pitted) in blender. With lid on, blend until completely mixed and liquid consistency. Salsa should be the consistency of crema, liquid, yet slightly viscous.\n\nPour over your tacos liberally. Refrigerate between uses.\n\ntags: vegetarian\n",

    "recipe": "#Sauted Shitake Mushroom and Wasabi Salad\n\n\n- 1 cup dried shitake mushrooms \n- Splash of soy sauce\n- Splash of red wine vinegar\n- Splash of olive oil\n- Wasabi-covered sesame seeds (available at the local Asian mart. If you can't find it, sub just a smidge of wasabi)\n- Pinch of salt\n\nPlace shitakes in a bowl and cover with warm water. Soak for about 20 minutes or until shitakes are completely rehydrated. Remove mushrooms and squeeze excess water from them. They don't need to be completely dry, but shouldn't be sopping wet.\n\nHeat olive oil over medium-high heat in a small frying pan. Throw in soy sauce and red wine vinegar. How much depends on your taste. I would start with a tablespoon of each and adjust from there. I like the salad to be a bit more acidic so I tend to add a splash more of the red wine vinegar. Sauté mushrooms for a couple of minutes until they are heated through. Season to taste with salt. Adjust soy sauce and red wine vinegar as needed. Before serving, sprinkle a little bit of the wasabi-covered sesame seeds over the mushrooms to impart a little color, crunchiness, and heat. If you are unable to find wasabi-covered sesame seeds, a dab of wasabi and sprinkle of plain sesame seeds should do the trick. \n\nNote: I keep dried shitakes as a staple in my pantry. I love the fact that the water left over after you rehydrate the mushrooms is called mushroom liquor. Mushroom liquor can be used as a substitute for broth or water in many recipes to impart an lovely mushroomy flavor.",

Cut up your chops unevenly with the scissors. Go for an average of chopped bits around 1\" in size or so, but variation is good, especially little bits. Those little bits are going to turn into crispy bits of goodness. When you..\n\nToss all this into a high-heat pan (cast iron, if you've got it) and fry it up so that it chars up real nice. The little bits will turn into little charred chunks--this is a feature, not a bug.\n\nPrior to the pan-tossing, you should spice up your pork with a good rub or marinade. If you're looking, I recommend the [sriracha marinade](/seasonings/sriracha_marinade.md).\n",
